        "1. DeepSentiPeer: Automatically validating a research artefact is one of the frontiers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that directly brings it close to competing with human intellect and intuition.\n",
        "Although criticised sometimes, the existing peer review system still stands as the benchmark of research validation.\n",
        "The present-day peer review process is not straightforward and demands profound domain knowledge, expertise, and intelligence of human reviewer (s), which is somewhat elusive with the current state of AI.\n",
        "However, the peer review texts, which contains rich sentiment information of the reviewer, reflecting his/her overall attitude towards the research in the paper, could be a valuable entity to predict the acceptance or rejection of the manuscript under consideration.\n",
        "Here in this work, we investigate the role of reviewer sentiment embedded within peer review texts to predict the peer review outcome.\n",
        "Our proposed deep neural architecture takes into account three channels of information: the paper, the corresponding reviews, and review’s polarity to predict the overall recommendation score as well as the final decision.\n",
        "We achieve significant performance improvement over the baselines (29% error reduction) proposed in a recently released dataset of peer reviews.\n",
        "An AI of this kind could assist the editors/program chairs as an additional layer of confidence, especially when non-responding/missing reviewers are frequent in present day peer review.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Misinformation detection using multitask learning with mutual learning for novelty detection and emotion recognition: Fake news or misinformation is the information or stories intentionally created to deceive or mislead the readers.\n",
        "Nowadays, social media platforms have become the ripe grounds for misinformation, spreading them in a few minutes, which led to chaos, panic, and potential health hazards among people.\n",
        "The rapid dissemination and a prolific rise in the spread of fake news and misinformation create the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community.\n",
        "Relevant literature reveals that the presence of an element of surprise in the story is a strong driving force for the rapid dissemination of misinformation, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader.\n",
        "False stories or fake information are written to arouse interest and activate the emotions of people to spread it. Thus, false stories have a higher level of novelty and emotional content than true.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Novelty Goes Deep. A Deep Neural Solution To Document Level Novelty Detection: The rapid growth of documents across the web has necessitated finding means of discarding redundant documents and retaining novel ones.\n",
        "Capturing redundancy is challenging as it may involve investigating at a deep semantic level. Techniques for detecting such semantic redundancy at the document level are scarce.\n",
        "In this work we propose a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based model to classify a document as novel or redundant with respect to a set of relevant documents already seen by the system.\n",
        "The system is simple and do not require any manual feature engineering.\n",
        "Our novel scheme encodes relevant and relative information from both source and target texts to generate an intermediate representation which we coin as the Relative Document Vector (RDV).\n",
        "The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art on a document-level novelty detection dataset by a margin of 5% in terms of accuracy.\n",
        "We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a standard paraphrase detection dataset where paraphrased passages closely resemble to semantically redundant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tirthankar Ghosal's last year the author published 4 papers following are the title with there takeaways:\n",
        "1. Overview of the First Shared Task on Automatic Minuting (AutoMin) at Interspeech 2021 : In this article, we report the findings of the First Shared Task on Automatic Minuting (AutoMin).\n",
        "The primary objective of the AutoMin shared task was to garner community participation to create minutes from multi-party meetings automatically.\n",
        "The shared task was endorsed by the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA) and was also an Interspeech 2021 satellite event.\n",
        "AutoMin was held virtually on September 4, 2021.\n",
        "The motivation for AutoMin was to bring together the Speech and Natural Language Processing (NLP) community to jointly investigate the challenges and propose innovative solutions for this timely yet important use case.\n",
        "Ten different teams from diverse backgrounds participated in the shared task and presented their systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What the fake? Probing misinformation detection standing on the shoulder of novelty and emotion: One of the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community is to combat the spread of fake news and misinformation.\n",
        "Existing approaches for misinformation detection use neural network models, statistical methods, linguistic traits, fact-checking strategies, etc.\n",
        "However, the menace of fake news seems to grow more vigorous with the advent of humongous and unusually creative language models.\n",
        "Relevant literature reveals that one major characteristic of the virality of fake news is the presence of an element of surprise in the story, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader.\n",
        "In this work, we leverage this idea and propose textual novelty detection and emotion prediction as the two tasks relating to automatic misinformation detection.\n",
        "We re-purpose textual entailment for novelty detection and use the models trained on large-scale datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Peer review analyze: A novel benchmark resource for computational analysis of peer reviews: Peer Review is at the heart of scholarly communications and the cornerstone of scientific publishing.\n",
        "However, academia often criticizes the peer review system as non-transparent, biased, arbitrary, a flawed process at the heart of science, leading to researchers arguing with its reliability and quality.\n",
        "These problems could also be due to the lack of studies with the peer-review texts for various proprietary and confidentiality clauses.\n",
        "Peer review texts could serve as a rich source of Natural Language Processing (NLP) research on understanding the scholarly communication landscape, and thereby build systems towards mitigating those pertinent problems.\n",
        "In this work, we present a first of its kind multi-layered dataset of 1199 open peer review texts manually annotated at the sentence level (17k sentences) across the four layers, viz.\n",
        "Paper Section Correspondence, Paper Aspect Category, Review Functionality, and Review Significance.\n",
        "Given a text written by the reviewer, we annotate: to which sections (e.g., Methodology, Experiments, etc.), what aspects (e.g., Originality/Novelty,\n",
        "Empirical/Theoretical Soundness, etc.) of the paper does the review text correspond to, what is the role played by the review text (e.g., appreciation, criticism, summary, etc.), and the importance of the review statement (major, minor, general) within the review.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Testing the generalization of neural language models for COVID-19 misinformation detection: A drastic rise in potentially life-threatening misinformation has been a by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
        "Computational support to identify false information within the massive body of data on the topic is crucial to prevent harm.\n",
        "Researchers proposed many methods for flagging online misinformation related to COVID-19. However, these methods predominantly target specific content types (e.g., news) or platforms (e.g., Twitter).\n",
        "The methods capabilities to generalize were largely unclear so far. We evaluate fifteen Transformer-based models on five COVID-19 misinformation datasets that include social media posts, news articles, and scientific papers to fill this gap.\n",
        "We show tokenizers and models tailored to COVID-19 data do not provide a significant advantage over general-purpose ones. Our study provides a realistic assessment of models for detecting COVID-19 misinformation.\n",
